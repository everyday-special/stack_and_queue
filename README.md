## Stacks and Queues

Model a waiting list of parties at a restaurant using a queue (circular linked list). Once a party is seated, they are added to a stack (dynamically allocated array) modeling recent customers who should receive promotional material for the restaurant.

To run:
1. `make`
2. `./proj2`
